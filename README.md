# End-to-End Document RAG

This project implements a full **Document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. Given a user’s query and a set of documents (PDFs, text, etc.), the system retrieves relevant contexts and then uses a generative model to produce a response grounded in those documents. It includes data ingestion, preprocessing, vector embeddings, retrieval, generation, user interface, and evaluation.

## Installation

These steps assume you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AcolyteOfTheWay/End-to-End-Document-RAG.git
   cd End-to-End-Document-RAG
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate      # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) If you have GPU and want to use it with certain embedding / large model libraries, ensure relevant toolkits (like CUDA, PyTorch with GPU support) are set up.

## Usage

Below are typical workflow steps to get the system up and running.

### Preprocessing Documents

* Place raw documents (PDFs, text files) in `Data/raw/`.
* Run document loading & cleaning script (this may extract text, remove noise, etc.).
* The cleaned or extracted text is saved in `Data/processed/`.

### Indexing & Embeddings

* Use the embedding model to convert document chunks to vector embeddings.
* Store the embeddings along with metadata (document name, chunk ids etc.) in `Data/embeddings/` (or whichever directory is configured).
* Build a vector store / index (could be FAISS, or another similarity search engine) for fast retrieval.

### Running the Streamlit App

* Run the UI:

  ```bash
  streamlit run streamlit_app.py
  ```
* In the UI, you can enter a query and view the generated answer along with retrieved document contexts.

### Querying & Generation

* The system retrieves top-k relevant chunks for the user’s query using the embedding + vector store.
* These contexts are passed to a generative model (specified via config) which produces a response.
* Options for the generative model (temperature, max tokens etc.) are adjustable in config or via command-line arguments.

---

## Configuration

Key configurable components:

* **Embedding model**: Which model is used to embed text (e.g. sentence-transformers, OpenAI embeddings etc.).
* **Chunk size / overlap**: How big each document chunk is, and how much overlap between chunks.
* **Top-k retrieval**: How many context chunks to fetch for each query.
* **Generation model & parameters**: Which LLM is used, its prompt template, temperature, max tokens, etc.
* **Paths / directories**: Where raw data, processed data, embeddings, and vector store are stored.

Configuration is done via files in `config/` directory and/or environment variables.

---

## Dependencies

Some of the main Python packages used:

* `streamlit` — for UI
* Embedding library (e.g. `sentence-transformers` or similar)
* Generative model library (e.g. `transformers`, OpenAI, etc.)
* Vector store / similarity search tool (e.g. `faiss`, `annoy`, `hnswlib`)
* PDF/text parsing tools (e.g. `pdfplumber`, `PyPDF2`, or other)
* Utilities: `numpy`, `pandas`, etc.

All required versions are listed in `requirements.txt`.

---

## Data

* The directory `Data/raw/` contains the original documents to be used.
* After processing, document texts (cleaned) are stored in `Data/processed/`.
* Embeddings + vector store data are stored in `Data/embeddings/`.

If you want to use your own documents, follow the same folder conventions:

1. Put raw documents into `Data/raw/`.
2. Run preprocessing + embedding pipeline to populate `processed/` and `embeddings/`.

## How It Works (Architecture)

Here’s the high-level flow of what the system does:

1. **Document Ingestion**: Read documents from disk, parse PDF or text files, extract text.
2. **Text Cleaning & Splitting**: Normalize text (remove boilerplate, non-text stuff), then split long documents into chunks (based on a configurable size and overlap).
3. **Embedding Generation**: For each chunk, generate a vector embedding.
4. **Vector Store / Indexing**: Store chunk embeddings with metadata in a vector store for similarity search.
5. **Query Handling**: When user submits a query:
   a. Embed the query using same embedding model.
   b. Search vector store for top-k similar chunks.
6. **Answer Generation**: Provide the query + retrieved contexts to a generative model to produce an answer.
7. **UI + Interaction**: Through Streamlit app, let user ask queries and display both the answer and sources.

## Limitations & Possible Improvements

* **Accuracy / Hallucination**: Generated answers can still include incorrect or unsupported statements if retrieved contexts are insufficient.
* **Latency**: Embedding & retrieval can be slow for large document sets. Improvements: use more efficient vector databases, pre-cache embeddings, batch embedding.
* **Scaling**: For very large corpora, your vector store & memory usage may become bottlenecks.
* **Document Types**: Might be limited to PDFs and plain text; other formats (images, scanned docs) need OCR or extra preprocessing.
* **Evaluation**: Currently may lack automated evaluation metrics or ground truth to quantitatively measure performance.
